Hello, and welcome to my GitHub profile!

I'm a curious explorer and lifelong learner, having worked in the financial industry, where I tackle complex challenges daily. However, my curiosity doesn't stop at finance - I've cultivated a passion for data science and machine learning, dedicating my free time to self-learning and exploring these fields.

In this space, you'll find a growing collection of projects I've worked on, demonstrating my evolving skills and interests. Each project is a testament to my commitment to constant learning and improvement.

So feel free to look around, and don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or are interested in collaborating. I'll regularly update my projects here, so be sure to check back for new additions.

Thanks for stopping by!
